About KPhotoOrganizer
=====================
This is a script that I developed to reorganize my photo library after purchasing a new laptop with Windows. Surprisingly, there were no build in Windows 10 tools to automatically organize photos from a given folder into sub-folders, that would reference the month and day of when the photo was taken in the folder name. This script is being run on Windows, and I have not tested in on anything else then R version 3.6.3 (2020-02-29) and below:
* Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)
* Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 18363)
* Other attached packages: [1] dplyr_1.0.0

Fork It
=======
If you fork this and add some goodness, let me know with a Pull Request. I would be happy to add back into it.
One idea to extend the code would be to extract the EXIF data (GPS coordinates, and other values)
from each photo to incorporate it into the sub-folder name.
